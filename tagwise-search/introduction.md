# Tag wise search: Introduction

### How to build tag wise search engine with Elasticsearch?

 A tag is a type of label or metadata used on social network and blogging services which makes it easier for users to find the data with a specific theme or content. Also, it can be useful to filter the data according to the single or multiple categories.

In this chapter weâ€™re going to build tag wise search engine very similar as Github to search the repos according to the tags.

We will use [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) as our search engine and the index (and dataset) is hosted on an [appbase.io](https://appbase.io) app.
