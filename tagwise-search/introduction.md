# Tag wise search: Introduction

### How to build tag wise search functionality with Elasticsearch?

This chapter provides a simple introduction and guide to aggregate and search the data by tags. 

We will use [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) as our search engine and the index (and dataset) is hosted on an [appbase.io](https://appbase.io) app.
