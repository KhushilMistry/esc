### How to make normal search bar?

This chapter therefore provides a simple introduction and guide to develop normal search bar of either your products, cities, names or anything that can be two-three words query.

The main functionality we need for the normal text searching are

1. **Auto complete** - While user typing we need to provide auto completion for the input queries. Auto-complete functionality should be as fast as a user types to provide instant feedback relevant to what a user has already typed in.  Elasticsearch provides a convenient way to get autocomplete up and running quickly with its completion suggester feature.
2. **Suggestions**(or full text search) - Use quick suggestions to help users save time, iterate on their searches, and get the results they want. It helps to show the relevant data to userâ€™s inputs.

Elasticsearch can support to index the same field in different ways for different purposes. We will use the multi-fields provided by elasticsearch to store the data into three different fields. We need to make three sub fields related to three different functionalities.


**Note:** Read more about concepts of [multi-field](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/multi-fields.html).

**Note:** A short note on [analyzer](https://www.elastic.co/blog/found-text-analysis-part-1).

The field type for the autocomplete functionality must be completion. It can also be possible through n-grams and prefix suggester algorithms. We will use simple analyzer instead of standard. Because standard analyzer will split the words by spaces.

**Note:** Read more about [n-grams](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/analysis-ngram-tokenizer.html).

For the suggestions we will use string type field with n-grams analyzer and white space analyzer.

We will predefine the type and  analyzer of fields by mappings.

### Mapping

```bash
curl -XPUT $host/searchbar/_settings?pretty -d '{
  "analysis": {
    "tokenizer": {
      "ngramizer": {
        "type": "edge_ngram",
        "min_gram": 1,
        "max_gram": 10,
        "token_chars": [
          "letter",
          "digit",
          "punctuation",
          "symbol"
        ]
      }
  },
    "analyzer": {
      "auto-suggest": {
        "type": "custom",
        "tokenizer": "ngramizer",
        "filter": [
          "lowercase",
          "asciifolding"
        ]
      },
      "case_insensitive": {
        "tokenizer": "keyword",
        "filter": [
          "lowercase"
        ]
      }
    }
  }  
}'
```
```bash
curl -XPUT $host/searchbar/_mapping/searchbar -d '{
  "searchbar": {
    "properties": {
      "city": {
        "type": "string",
        "fields": {
          "city_autocomplete": {
            "type": "completion",
            "analyzer": "case_insensitive",
            "search_analyzer": "case_insensitive",
            "payloads": false
          },
          "city_autosuggest": {
            "type": "string",
            "analyzer": "auto-suggest",
            "search_analyzer": "standard"
          }
        }
      },
      "country": {
        "type": "string",
        "fields": {
          "country_autocomplete": {
            "type": "completion",
            "analyzer": "case_insensitive",
            "search_analyzer": "case_insensitive",
            "payloads": false
          },
          "country_autosuggest": {
            "type": "string",
            "analyzer": "auto-suggest",
            "search_analyzer": "standard"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'  
```

### Data Indexing
```bash
curl -XPUT $host/searchbar/searchbar/1 -d '{
  "city": "New York",
  "country": "United States"
}'
```
